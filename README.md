# c_passgen

## Description
This is a password generator highly similar to the one I wrote
in c++. See my [PasswordGen](https://www.github.com/ArmaanCPro/PasswordGen) repo.
But, this one is written in C. It uses libsodium to generate random passwords.

There are still a lot of features left to be added, and I am definitely less experienced
at C than C++. This project is really just a learning exercise for me, and a way to get better at C.

## Dependencies
- `CMake` (Must be preinstalled V3.28 or higher)
- `vcpkg`
- `libsodium`
